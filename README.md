# JavaScript Learning – From Zero to Real Projects

This repository is a complete, structured path to learn JavaScript from absolute basics to building real browser projects and preparing for interviews.

You will move in a clear order:

1. Fundamentals (syntax, variables, data types, operators)
2. Control flow (conditions, loops)
3. Functions, arrays, and objects
4. DOM and events (making web pages interactive)
5. Advanced concepts (scope, closures, hoisting, `this`)
6. Asynchronous JavaScript (callbacks, promises, async/await, fetch)
7. Mini projects, interview prep, and revision

## Who this course is for

- Absolute beginners who want to learn programming with JavaScript.
- Frontend beginners who know basic HTML/CSS and want to add interactivity.
- Backend or data people who want a solid JavaScript foundation before frameworks.

You only need basic computer skills and a browser (Chrome/Firefox) to start.

## How to use this repository

Follow the folders in numeric order. Each topic is broken into:

- `theory.md` – Concept explanation in simple language.
- `*.js` – Example and practice code.
- `quiz.md` / `mini-task.md` – Short questions or small tasks.
- `Mindmap.png` – Visual summary you can use for quick revision.

Recommended daily routine:

1. Read the theory for the current topic.
2. Run the example `.js` files in your browser console or a simple HTML file.
3. Try the practice tasks without looking at the solution.
4. Attempt the quiz and review answers.
5. Revisit the mindmap at the end.

See `00-How-to-Use-This-Course/README.md` for a detailed learning plan.

```
This structure follows widely recommended JavaScript learning sequences (fundamentals → DOM → advanced → async → projects).

## Prerequisites and tools

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A code editor (VS Code recommended).
- Basic HTML/CSS helps but is not mandatory.

Optional but helpful:

- Node.js (to run `.js` files from the terminal).
- Git + GitHub to track your progress.
