# JavaScript Learning Plan

This is a practical study plan for the `JavaScript-Learning` repository. Use it as a guide and adjust the pace depending on how much time you have each day.

The plan is written for about **8 weeks**, assuming ~1–1.5 hours of focused study per day. If you can study more, you can compress it; if less, spread it out. [web:68][web:82][web:83]

## Overview by weeks

- **Weeks 1–2**: JavaScript basics + control flow
- **Weeks 3–4**: Functions, arrays, objects
- **Weeks 5–6**: DOM, advanced JavaScript (scope, closures, hoisting, `this`)
- **Weeks 7–8**: Asynchronous JavaScript, mini-projects, interview prep, revision [web:68][web:83][web:85]

You should always combine **theory → practice → quiz → mini project** as you move.

## Adjusting the plan

- If you are fast: combine two small days into one (e.g., operators + conditionals). [web:68][web:85]
- If you are busy: treat each “day” above as a **session**, not a calendar day.
- If you get stuck: pause the schedule, repeat practice and quizzes until the concept feels clear.

Consistency matters more than speed. Aim to touch JavaScript every day, even for 30–45 minutes. [web:87]
