# Common JavaScript Interview Questions

## 1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to create interactive web pages and applications.

## 2. What are the data types in JavaScript?

- **Primitive**: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt
- **Non-primitive**: Object

## 3. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?

- `==` compares values with type coercion
- `===` compares values and types (strict equality)

## 4. What is hoisting?

Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before code execution.

## 5. What is a closure?

A closure is a function that has access to variables from its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.

## 6. What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?

- `var`: Function-scoped, hoisted
- `let`: Block-scoped, not hoisted
- `const`: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned

## 7. What is the event loop?

The event loop handles asynchronous operations in JavaScript by managing the call stack and callback queue.

## 8. What are arrow functions?

Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions (ES6), and they don't have their own `this` binding.

## 9. What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML documents, representing the page as a tree of objects.

## 10. What is a Promise?

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

## 11. What is async/await?

Async/await is syntactic sugar for Promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous.

## 12. What is the spread operator?

The spread operator (`...`) expands an array or object into individual elements.

## 13. What is destructuring?

Destructuring is a way to extract values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

## 14. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

- `undefined`: Variable declared but not assigned
- `null`: Intentional absence of value

## 15. What are higher-order functions?

Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.

## 16. What is the `this` keyword?

`this` refers to the object that is executing the current function.

## 17. What are callbacks?

Functions passed as arguments to other functions, to be executed later.

## 18. What is event bubbling?

Event bubbling is when an event propagates from the target element up through its ancestors.

## 19. What is localStorage?

localStorage is a web storage API that stores data with no expiration time.

## 20. What are template literals?

Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions, using backticks.
